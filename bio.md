I'm an Associate Professor in the [UW Allen School](http://cs.washington.edu/), a Sloan Fellow, and NSF CAREER Awardee. My research is in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with a focus on high-value social domains such as accessibility, environmental sustainability, and STE(A)M education.

### Graduate studies

I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Washington in December 2011 where I was co-advised by Professors [James Landay](https://www.landay.org/) and [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/). During my PhD, I was honored to receive a Microsoft Research Graduate Fellowship and the 2010 College of Engineering "Graduate Innovator of the Year" award. My PhD dissertation entitled ["Sensing and Feedback of Everyday Activities to Promote Environmental Behaviors"](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Sensing_and_Feedback_of_Everyday_Activities_to_Promote_Environmental_Behaviors_Eye7nYF.pdf) earned distinctive recognition including the [2012 University of Washington Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/thesisdissertation/dissertation-and-thesis-awards/), [the William Chan Memorial Dissertation Award](https://www.cs.washington.edu/education/award_winning_students/chan), and an *Honorable Mention* for the national 2012 Council of Graduate Schools Distinguished Dissertation Award in Mathematics, Physical Sciences, and Engineering.

One dissertation project, called HydroSense, applied supervised learning algorithms to disaggregate and track water usage from a single sensing point using pressure wave signatures. With co-inventors [James Fogarty](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/), [Shwetak Patel](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~shwetak/), and [Eric Larson](https://s2.smu.edu/~eclarson/), this technology was patented, licensed, and commercialized by Belkin, Inc. It is marketed as the [Phyn smart water sensor](https://www.phyn.com/).

During my graduate studies, I had the opportunity to intern premier research labs including Microsoft Research in Redmond, Intel Research in Seattle, and Telefonica Research in Barcelona. In 2004, I completed a MS in Information and Computer Science from the University of California, Irvine where I was advised by [Paul Dourish](https://www.dourish.com/). 

### University of Maryland

From 2012-2017, I was an Assistant Professor in [CS](http://cs.umd.edu/) and [HCIL faculty](https://hcil.umd.edu/) at the [University of Maryland in College Park](http://www.umd.edu) where I collaborated closely with Professor [David Jacobs](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~djacobs/) on [NSF #1302338](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1302338) _Combining Crowdsourcing and Computer Vision for Street-level Accessibility_, Professor [Tamara Clegg](https://ischool.umd.edu/about/directory/tamara-clegg) on [NSF #1441184](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1441184&HistoricalAwards=false) _BodyVis: Advancing New Science Learning and Inquiry Experiences via Custom Designed Wearable On-Body Sensing and Visualization_, and Professors [Rama Chellappa](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~rama/) and [Leah Findlater](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NeDnx2EAAAAJ&hl=en) on US Army Medical Research Award [W81XWH-14-1-0617](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1002552.pdf) _HandSight: Supporting Everyday Activities through Touch-Vision_.

### Publications and paper awards

Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to learn from and collaborate with top scholars and students, leading to 100+ scientific peer-reviewed [publications](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/publications/) in premiere venues such as ACM CHI, UbiComp, DIS, IJCAI, MobiSys, ASSETS, and ICSE. Sixteen papers have earned awards, including: seven *Best Papers* (CHI'10, CHI'13, ASSETS'13, CHI'16 LBW, 2 x CHI'19, ASSETS'19) and nine *Best Paper Honorable Mentions* (UbiComp'09, CHI'12, CHI'13, 2 x CHI'15, ASSETS'19, CHI'19, CHI'21, DIS'21). In addition, our UIST'14 paper on [Tohme](https://makeabilitylab.cs.washington.edu/media/publications/Hara_TohmeDetectingCurbRampsInGoogleStreetViewUsingCrowdsourcingComputerVisionAndMachineLearning_2014.pdf) was selected for the ACM Computing Reviews 'Best of Computing 2014' list.
